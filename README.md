# DM_Player
using embeded windows media player to create niconico like video player  that reads comments in XML format

Instructions

press open on the top right and 

--->set media to set the media file you want to play
--->set DM to select the XML file that contains the comments

click on the player screen or the play button to play  while playing click on the screen again will pause the video and the comments




to do list :

-planning to add play comment list functions on the later versions and will try to embed a different video player (most likely vlc player)

-thinking about adding a feature for user to add their own comments but, probably will be pointless if there's no way to sync it with

-others, it's going to more like a note to self thing.


-finally after all that will try create a feature that fetches comments/with video on certain website by just right click &copying the url.

-the sample XML file is just there to test I do not own or create it , you can get more xml comment files on

known bugs:

-while playing the comments will float extra fast when the pointer is out side of the program

-in full screen mode (double click the screen)  no comment will be displayed
