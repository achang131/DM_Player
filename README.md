# DM_Player
using embeded windows media player to create niconico like video player  that reads comments in XML format

to do list 

planning to add play comment list functions on the later versions and will try to embed a different video player (most likely vlc player)

thinking about adding a feature for user to add their own comments but, probably will be pointless if there's no way to sync it with

others, it's going to more like a note to self thing.


finally after all that will try create a feature that fetches comments/with video on certain website by just right click &copying the url.
